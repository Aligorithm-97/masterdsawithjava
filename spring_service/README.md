# Spring Boot Advanced Starter Pack

This repository serves as an advanced Spring Boot starter pack, designed to streamline development with pre-configured
integrations for database connections, Spring Security with JWT  (including refresh token mechanism), email services, and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
for logging. Developers can quickly adapt this project with minimal configuration adjustments to meet their needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17** & **Gradle** (recommended version: **8.10.2**).
- **PostgreSQL** or **SQL Server** installed for database support.
- **Gmail** account for email integration.

---

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aligorithm-97/SpringBootAdvancedStarterPack.git
   cd SpringBootAdvancedStarterPack
   
2. **Install Java 17 and Gradle**
   - Ensure **Java 17** is installed on your system.
   - Install **Gradle** (recommended version: **8.10.2**) if not already installed.

3. **Database Setup**
   - **SQL Server**:
      - Update `application-dev.properties` with your SQL Server details:
        ```properties
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://<your-sql-server-url>:<port>;databaseName=<database>
        spring.datasource.username=<your-username>
        spring.datasource.password=<your-password>
        ```
   - **PostgreSQL**:
      - Install **PostgreSQL** if it is not already installed.
      - Use **pgAdmin** to create a new database.
      - Update `application-dev.properties` with your PostgreSQL details:
        ```properties
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://<host>:<port>/<database>
        spring.datasource.username=<your-username>
        spring.datasource.password=<your-password>
        ```

4. **Email Integration**
   - Generate an app-specific password in your Gmail account.
   - Update `application-dev.properties` with your Gmail credentials:
     ```properties
     spring.mail.mailUsername=<your-email>
     spring.mail.mailPassword=<app-password>
     ```

5. **CORS Configuration**
   - By default, the **CORS** configuration allows all ports for development purposes.
   - Update the allowed origins in `BeansConfig` for production as needed:
     ```java
     configuration.setAllowedOrigins(Arrays.asList(<your-domain-or-ip>));
     ```

6. **Activate User Accounts**
   - Add the URL of your UI for account activation in `application-dev.properties`:
     ```properties
     application.mailing.frontend.activation-url=http://<your-ui-url>/activate
     ```

7. **Troubleshooting**
   - If all the above steps have been completed and you still encounter errors, it could be due to the **Lombok annotation processor** not functioning correctly.
   - To resolve this:
      - Ensure Lombok is installed and enabled in your IDE.
      - For IntelliJ IDEA:
         1. Go to **File > Settings > Plugins**, search for `Lombok`, and install it if itâ€™s not already installed.
         2. Enable annotation processing:  
            **File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation Processors**, and check **Enable annotation processing**.

## Key Features

1. **Database Integration**
   - **PostgreSQL**: Pre-configured in `application-dev.properties`. Simply install PostgreSQL, create the database using **pgAdmin**, and update properties such as `port`, `database name`, and `credentials` as needed.
   - **SQL Server**: Configuration is available for SQL Server. Update the necessary details and include the required dependencies in `build.gradle` to switch to SQL Server.

2. **Spring Security with JWT**
   - Includes **JSON Web Token (JWT)** authentication for securing APIs.
   - **Supports Refresh Token Mechanism**:
     - Enables seamless token renewal without requiring users to re-authenticate.
     - Designed for use with front-end interceptors to manage token refresh automatically.
     - Pre-configured endpoints for obtaining access and refresh tokens.
   - **CORS Configuration**:
      - Development: Allow origins like `localhost` and specific ports.
      - Production: Set allowed origins to your domain or IP in the `BeansConfig` class.

3. **Email Integration**
   - Pre-configured for email sending using Gmail.
   - **Setup Instructions**:
      1. Generate an app-specific password in your Gmail account.
      2. Update `application-dev.properties` with your Gmail username and app password.

4. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**
   - Includes logging functionality for cross-cutting concerns.

5. **Global Exception Handling**
   - Pre-configured global exception handler for managing API errors consistently.

6. **Environment Support**
   - Built with **Java 17**.
   - Uses **Gradle** for dependency management and build.
